GZDoom installation Guide

This file contains instructions for building GZDoom. Currently this
guide only contains instructions for Gnu/Linux but it is possible the
steps is applicable to other operating systems as well.

1.  Install the required dependencies. Depending on your distro they
    may have different package names. These are:

    Required
      - gcc 4.8 or later
      - make
      - cmake 2.8.7 or later
      - SDL 2.0.2 or later
      - libGL and libGLU (SDL or libSDL pull in libGLU) or any other
        GL implementation provider.
      - ZMusic (See below)
    Recommended
      - GTK3 or GTK2
      - git (needed in order to download the source and compile in
        commit meta data)
      - nasm 0.98.39 or later (x86-32 only)
    Optional
      - zlib (GZDoom has a copy of it and will be statically compiled
        in if not found)
      - libbzip2 (possibly static)
      - libjpeg (possibly static)
      - libgme or game-music-emu (possibly static)
      - SDL 1.2.8 or later 1.2.x versions (for GZDoom 1.x)
      - libglew (for GZDoom 1.x)
      - FMOD Ex 4.36.x or later or FMOD Studio (for GZDoom 1.x and
        2.x) Runtime
      - gxmessage (optional - needed to show the crash log in a
        window)
      - kdialog (optional - for KDE users)
      - fluidsynth (optional - for MIDI playback)

    In addition to or instead of FMOD, OpenAL can be used for sound in
    which case the following are required:

      - libopenal
      - libmpg123
      - libsndfile

1a. Make sure ZMusic is installed, either through your package manager
    or by building it yourself.

	$ git clone --depth 1 -b 1.1.6 https://github.com/coelckers/ZMusic.git
	$ cd ZMusic
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`/../build_install ..

2.  Build GZDoom.

    If you acquired GZDOOM through git you may want to checkout the
    stable version, which as of time of writing is 4.5.0:

	$ git checkout g4.5.0

    If you built ZMusic yourself, set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to the full
    path of the build_install directory set above, otherwise remove
    the option entirely.

	$ cd GZDoom
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=../ZMusic/build/build_install/ ..
	$ make

3.  If all works you should have a executable program in build/gzdoom.

	$ build/gzdoom

4.  (Optional) You may want to move GZDoom to its installation directories.

	# make install
